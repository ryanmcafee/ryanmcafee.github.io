    # What is Redux?

    * Redux is a front-end library for handling client-side application state in a centralized manner.

    * Deterministic state management – same state always renders same view (pure functions – functional programming).

    * Immutable, centralized state management for web applications/ js applications.

    * Created by Dan Abramov around June 2015.

    * Inspired by Facebook's Flux (multiple stores) and the functional programming language Elm.

    * Front-end framework agnostic – can be used with Angular, React, Vue Js, etc..

    ---

    #Core Redux Concepts

    * Store is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:

      `const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer, initialApplicationState);`

      * Holds application state;
      * Allows access to state via getState();
      * Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
      * Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
      * Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

    * Action – A js object that has a type and other optional fields.

      `{ type: 'ADD_TODO', id: 1, text: "Pick up milk from grocery"}`

    * State – A plain js object that stores your application state in the form of key -> value pairs. 
      
      `{ todos: [{id: 1, text: "Pick up milk from grocery"}]}`

    ---

    #Core Redux Concepts - Continued
    
    * Reducer – A pure (no side effects) function that is responsible for updating the application state. Ties actions and state together. 
      * Method Signature: (state, action) => newState;

        ```
        const todos = (state = [], action) => {
          switch (action.type) {
            case 'ADD_TODO':
              return [
                ...state,
                {
                  id: action.id,
                  text: action.text,
                  completed: false
                }
              ]
            case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
              return state.map(todo =>
                (todo.id === action.id)
                  ? {...todo, completed: !todo.completed}
                  : todo
              )
            default:
              return state
          }
        }
        ```

    #Three Principles

    * Single Source of truth

    * State is read-only
      * Only way to change the state is to dispatch (emit) an action using store.dispatch(action) which will then hit middleware and then hit the root reducer where a new application state is evaluated.

    * Changes are made with pure functions

      * Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.
      * Should be repeatable with a unit test. Same inputs always results in same output 100% of time.

    #Redux Data Flow

    * Unidirectional Data Flow

    * Redux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow

    * Inspired by Flux, CQRS, and Event Sourcing

    # Why Redux?
      * Dan Abramov built Redux out of frustration with feature iteration time and dev experience
        * Not satisfied with the "status quo"

      * Goal: Improve Developer Experience/ Efficiency
        * Work smarter, not harder.
        * Losing application state on refresh is frustrating (lost time)
        * Having to refresh the page manually is frustrating (lost time)
        * Not being able to reproduce (replay) a user's session (front-end events) is frustrating (lost time)
        * Not having centralized, event driven logging is frustrating (lost time)

      * Goal: Create a state management library with a minimal api, but completely predicatable behavior.
        * Result - Redux - Makes it possible to implement (without any buy-in from the developer)
          * Logging
          * Hot Reloading
          * Time travel
          * Universal (isomorphic) apps - Works on client/ server
          * Record and replay

    # Redux Trade Offs
      * Describe application state as plain objects and arrays

      * Describe changes in the system as plain objects

      * Describe the logic for handling state updates in the form of reducer functions (reducers) which is a pure function (no side effects)

      * Redux introduces boiler plate code (action types, action creator, action, reducer)

      * Redux introduces indirection to state management (need to use action type, action and reducer to update state) vs customer.firstName = "Peter";

    # When should I consider using Redux in my application?
      * You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time

      * You need a single source of truth for your state

      * You find that keeping all state in a "top-level component" is no longer sufficient

      * You have a very event driven application

      * Consult use cases

    # What can Redux help me accomplish?

      * Persist state to a local storage and then boot up from it, out of the box.

      * Pre-fill state on the server, send it to the client in HTML, and boot up from it, out of the box.

      * Serialize user actions and attach them, together with a state snapshot, to automated bug reports, so that the product developers can replay them to reproduce the errors.

      * Pass action objects over the network to implement collaborative environments without dramatic changes to how the code is written (custom realtime redux middleware).

      * Maintain an undo history or implement optimistic mutations without dramatic changes to how the code is written.

      * Travel between the state history in development, and re-evaluate the current state from the action history when the code changes, a la TDD.

      * Provide full inspection and control capabilities to the development tooling so that product developers can build custom tools for their apps.

      * Provide alternative UIs while reusing most of the business logic.
