    # What is Redux?

    * Redux is a front-end library for handling client-side application state in a centralized manner.

    * Immutable, centralized state management for web applications/ js applications.

    * Created by Dan Abramov around June 2015.

    * Inspired by Facebook's Flux (multiple stores) and the functional programming language Elm.

    * Front-end framework agnostic – can be used with Angular, React, Vue Js, etc..

    # Why Redux? Motivation

    * Deterministic state management – same state always renders same view (pure functions – functional programming).

    * User workflows are complex

    * You have a multi-page application that needs to use shared data throughout the application. Update the data in a single place and subscribe to the store throughout the application.

    * You are using web sockets, Server-Side Events or an event driven architecture – Useful in collaborative apps

    * You want to have a "single source of truth" for your application to simplify things.

    * Having a single state store allows for easy serialization of the application state and resuming the state at a later time. (redux-persist)

    * Ease of debugging and development (Redux DevTools).

    * Extensibility through custom middleware (Side Effects)

    * You want to track ui events in your application, log the events, and visualize the results to see how users are using your application.

    * Ability to replay front-end events and reconstruct a user’s application session. Associate individual front-end events with backend events. Gives you the ability to play a “video” of your user using the application https://logrocket.com/.

    #Core Concepts

    * Store – Manager that keeps state in memory, exposes dispatcher api for sending actions to store and has a subscribe/unsubscribe api for listening to events/ state updates.

    * Reducer – A function that is responsible for updating the application state. Ties actions and state together. Of the form: (state, action) => New State;

    * Action – A js object that has a type and other optional fields.

    * State – A plain js object that stores your application state in the form of key -> value pairs.

    #Redux Data Flow

    * Redux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow

    * Inspired by Flux, CQRS, and Event Sourcing
